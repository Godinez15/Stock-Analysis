# Stock-Analysis/Mod2Challenge
Module 2
So in this Module we basically learned to automate Excel using VBA. We learned about functions like Vlookup, Hlookup, =Sum etc.
Going into it deeper we wrote code or script in excel VBA to automate simple task or perform Complex Analysis. Then for the challenge we got a little glimpse of deconstructing a chunk of code and translated it into a simpler format.
